# Documentation

This repository uses the `@github/copilot-sdk` to power tool calling and streamed responses.

This `docs/` folder is intentionally lightweight and contains **project-specific notes and links**. For authoritative SDK behavior and APIs, refer to the upstream Copilot SDK documentation:

- https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk

If you change Copilot SDK usage (session creation, tools, events, streaming), please update the relevant notes under:

- `docs/concepts/` (how we use tools/sessions/events)
- `docs/api/` (what APIs/types we rely on)
